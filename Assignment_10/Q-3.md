# Q.3 What are REST API ?

REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs, based on the REST architectural style, are widely used for building networked applications. RESTful APIs follow a client-server architecture where the client, such as a web browser or a mobile application, communicates with the server over a network. These APIs emphasize stateless communication, meaning each client request contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and process it. The uniform interface of REST APIs involves resource identification through URIs/URLs, utilizing standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for performing operations on resources. Resources are represented in formats like JSON or XML, facilitating their exchange between client and server. REST APIs can take advantage of HTTP caching and can be designed in a layered system, allowing for scalability, flexibility, and compatibility with existing web technologies. Overall, REST APIs provide a standardized and efficient way to build web services for various applications, including web and mobile platforms.
