# Q.1 Explain Middlewares in NodeJS ?

In Node.js, middleware refers to a piece of software or a function that sits between the server and the application logic. It is responsible for processing and handling incoming requests and outgoing responses. Middlewares play a crucial role in extending the functionality of the Node.js web framework, such as Express.js.

Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects, and they can modify or augment them before passing them to the next middleware or the final route handler. They can also perform additional tasks like authentication, request parsing, error handling, logging, and more.
