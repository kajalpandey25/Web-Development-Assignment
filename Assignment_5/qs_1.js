// Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?
// Synchronous and asynchronous are terms used to describe different modes of communication and execution in various contexts, including computer programming, telecommunications, and teamwork. Here's a breakdown of the differences between the two:

// Synchronous:
// 1. Real-time communication: In synchronous communication, all participants involved are present and engaged at the same time. It operates on a "live" or immediate basis.
// 2. Blocking behavior: In synchronous operations, the execution flow is halted until a particular task is completed. This means that the program or process waits for the current operation to finish before moving on to the next one.
// 3. Timing dependence: Synchronous communication relies on strict timing and requires all parties to be available simultaneously. It often follows a fixed sequence or order.
// 4. Examples: Phone calls, face-to-face conversations, live video conferences, traditional classroom lectures.


// Asynchronous:

// 1. Delayed or non-real-time communication: Asynchronous communication does not require all participants to be available simultaneously. It allows for a time gap between sending and receiving messages.
// 2. Non-blocking behavior: In asynchronous operations, the execution flow continues immediately after initiating a task without waiting for its completion. It enables multitasking and parallel processing.
// 3. Timing independence: Asynchronous communication is not bound by strict timing constraints and allows for flexibility in terms of when participants can engage.
// 4. Examples: Email communication, text messages, discussion boards, sending letters by mail, posting on social media.
