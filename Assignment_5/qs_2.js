//  What are Web Apis ?

// Web APIs are typically used in web development to enable the integration of different systems, services, or data sources. They allow developers to leverage functionalities provided by other applications or platforms without having to build everything from scratch. These APIs define the methods, data formats, and communication protocols that developers need to follow to interact with the underlying system.

// There are various types of web APIs, including:

// 1. REST APIs (Representational State Transfer): REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources on the web. REST APIs are widely used and provide a stateless, scalable, and platform-independent way to access and manipulate data.

// 2. SOAP APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol): SOAP is a protocol that uses XML messages to exchange data between applications. SOAP APIs provide a more structured and formalized approach to web services but can be more complex to work with compared to REST APIs.

// 3. GraphQL APIs: GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs. It allows clients to request specific data and shape the response according to their needs, reducing the over-fetching and under-fetching of data commonly seen in REST APIs.

// 4. WebSocket APIs: WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables bidirectional, full-duplex communication between a client and a server. WebSocket APIs are used for real-time applications that require constant data exchange, such as chat applications or stock tickers.
