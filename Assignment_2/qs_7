<!-- Whatâ€™s Grid & Flex and difference between them? -->


Grid and Flexbox are two powerful CSS layout systems that provide different ways of arranging and aligning elements on a webpage. While both offer layout capabilities, they have distinct differences in terms of their approach and use cases.

1. Flexbox:
Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout system that aims to distribute space and align elements along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically. It is designed for creating flexible and responsive layouts within a single row or column.
Key features of Flexbox:

(i) One-dimensional: Flexbox operates along either the horizontal (main) axis or vertical (cross) axis, allowing flexible arrangement of elements in a single dimension.
(ii) Content-driven: Flexbox is ideal for dynamic content where elements adjust their sizes based on content or available space.

2. Grid:
CSS Grid Layout, or simply Grid, is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex grid structures with rows and columns. It provides precise control over the placement and positioning of elements in both directions simultaneously.
Key features of Grid:

(i) Two-dimensional: Grid allows you to create layouts with rows and columns, forming a grid structure that offers greater control over element positioning.
(ii) Grid tracks: You can define fixed or flexible-sized rows and columns using the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties.
