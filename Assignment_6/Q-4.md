# Q.4 Explain OOPS ? 

OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System. It is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which can be thought of as instances of classes. OOPS focuses on representing real-world entities as objects and provides mechanisms to define their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) as well as their interactions with other objects.
