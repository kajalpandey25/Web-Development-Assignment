Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming (OOP) that combines data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called an object. It involves bundling the data and the methods that manipulate that data together, and restricting direct access to the internal state of an object from outside.

The purpose of encapsulation is to provide data hiding, modularity, and abstraction in order to improve the robustness, security, and maintainability of code. Here are the main purposes and benefits of encapsulation:
