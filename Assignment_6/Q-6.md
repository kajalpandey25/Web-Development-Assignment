# Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?


Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows for the same method or operation to be performed on different objects, resulting in different behaviors based on the specific implementation of the objects. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility, reusability, and extensibility.

The purpose of polymorphism is to enable a single interface or method signature to represent multiple implementations. It provides a way to generalize behavior and handle different types of objects in a uniform manner. Here are the main purposes and benefits of polymorphism:
