# Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, a class is a template or blueprint for creating objects. It is a syntactical construct introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to facilitate object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Classes provide a way to define object types and their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).
JavaScript classes can also have static methods and getters/setters. Static methods are methods that belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class. Getters and setters are special methods used to get and set the values of specific properties.
