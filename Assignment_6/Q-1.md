Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?

A constructor is a special method or function that is used to initialize objects of a class. It is called automatically when an object is created, and its purpose is to set the initial state of the object and perform any necessary setup operations. The main purpose of a constructor is to ensure that an object is properly initialized before it can be used. It allows you to define the initial values of the object's attributes or properties, and it can also perform any additional setup tasks that may be required. Constructors are typically defined with the same name as the class and are often used to assign values to the instance variables of the class. They can take parameters, allowing you to pass initial values or arguments to the constructor when creating an object. By using constructors, you can ensure that objects are created in a consistent and valid state, and you can also encapsulate any complex initialization logic within the constructor, making it easier to create and use objects of the class.
