# Q.10 Whatâ€™s Super Keyword & What it does?

The super keyword in JavaScript is used to call the constructor or methods of a superclass from within a subclass. It ensures proper initialization and allows subclasses to inherit, extend, or modify the behavior of their parent classes. It is used to invoke the superclass constructor and access superclass methods. The super keyword plays a crucial role in achieving inheritance and code reuse in object-oriented programming.
