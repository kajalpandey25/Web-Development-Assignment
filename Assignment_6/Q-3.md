# Q.3 Whatâ€™s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them

The call, apply, and bind methods are built-in methods available in JavaScript that allow you to control the execution context of a function. 

1. call method:
The call method is used to invoke a function with a specified this value and individual arguments passed in. It takes the this value as its first argument, followed by the function arguments. The arguments are passed comma-separated. The call method immediately invokes the function.

2. apply method:
The apply method is similar to the call method, but it accepts the this value as its first argument, followed by an array-like object or an actual array containing the function arguments. The apply method immediately invokes the function.

3. bind method:
The bind method returns a new function with a bound this value and any initial arguments. Unlike call and apply, bind does not immediately invoke the function. Instead, it creates a new function with the specified this value and arguments, which can be invoked later.
