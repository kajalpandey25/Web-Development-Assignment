# Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves representing complex systems by simplifying and focusing on the essential features, while hiding unnecessary details. It allows you to create models or representations of real-world entities in a simplified and manageable manner.

The purpose of abstraction is to provide a clear and simplified view of an object or system by focusing on the most relevant aspects and hiding the underlying complexities. It allows you to define the essential characteristics and behaviors of an object without getting into the implementation details.
