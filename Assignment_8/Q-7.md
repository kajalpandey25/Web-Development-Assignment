# Q.7 Explain Prop Drilling in React & Ways to avoid it.

Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing props through multiple levels of nested components, even when some intermediate components don't need those props. It can result in code verbosity and make it harder to maintain or refactor components.

Ways to avoid prop drilling in React include:

1. Context API: Use the Context API to create a context object that can be accessed by nested components without explicitly passing props through each intermediate component.

2. Redux: Implement a state management library like Redux, which provides a global store to store and access application state, eliminating the need for prop drilling.

3. React Router: Utilize React Router to manage routing and navigation in your application. It provides a centralized location to access route information without the need for prop drilling.

4. Higher-Order Components (HOCs): Use HOCs to wrap components and provide additional props without explicitly passing them through the component tree.

5. Render Props: Implement the render props pattern, where a component accepts a function as a prop, which can be used to pass necessary data or functionality to nested components.
