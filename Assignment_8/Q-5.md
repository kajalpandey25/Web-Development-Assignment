# Q.5 Difference between class & function based component.

Class-based components and function-based components are two different approaches for creating components in React. Here's a comparison of the two:

# 1. Class-based components:

1. Class-based components are defined as JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class provided by React.
2. They have a render() method that returns JSX to define the component's UI.
3. Class-based components can have their own internal state managed through the this.state property, allowing them to track and update data over time.
4. They can also implement lifecycle methods like componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount() for controlling behavior during different phases of the component's existence.
5. Class-based components were the traditional way of writing components in React before the introduction of hooks in React 16.8.

# 2. Function-based components:

1. Function-based components are defined as JavaScript functions that receive props as input and return JSX as output.
2. They are simpler and more lightweight compared to class-based components.
Function-based components don't have their own internal state by default. However, with the introduction of React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, functional components can now have state and lifecycle capabilities.
3. Hooks allow functional components to manage local state, handle side effects, and implement lifecycle functionality without the need for a class.
4. Function-based components are considered the preferred approach in React for writing components due to their simplicity and the flexibility provided by hooks.
