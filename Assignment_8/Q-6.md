# Q.6 Explain react component life cycle.

In React, a component is a reusable and self-contained piece of code that defines the structure, behavior, and appearance of a part of the user interface. Components are the building blocks of React applications, allowing you to create modular and reusable UI elements.

There are two main types of components in React:

# 1.Functional Components:
Functional components are also known as stateless components or presentational components.
They are defined as JavaScript functions that receive props as input and return JSX (JavaScript XML) as output.
Functional components are simpler and easier to understand compared to class components.
They don't have their own internal state and are primarily used for presenting UI based on the provided props.
With the introduction of React hooks, functional components can also have state and lifecycle capabilities using hooks like useState, useEffect, and others.

# 2. Class Components:
Class components are also known as stateful components or container components.
They are defined as ES6 classes that extend the base React.Component class provided by React.
Class components have their own internal state, which allows them to manage and track data changes.
They can also implement lifecycle methods to control behavior during different phases of the component's existence.
Class components are commonly used for more complex logic, state management, and interaction with external data sources.
