# Q.4 Whats component? Types of component

A component in React is a reusable and self-contained piece of code that defines the structure, behavior, and appearance of a part of the user interface. There are two main types of components in React: functional components and class components.

Functional components are simpler and easier to understand, defined as JavaScript functions that receive props as input and return JSX as output. They are primarily used for presenting UI based on the provided props.

Class components, on the other hand, are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They have their own internal state, allowing them to manage and track data changes. Class components are commonly used for more complex logic, state management, and interaction with external data sources.
