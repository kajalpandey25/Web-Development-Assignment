# Q.3 Difference between Virtual Dom vs Real Dom.

# Virtual DOM:

1. Representation: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy or representation of the actual DOM. It is an abstract data structure maintained by React, independent of the browser's rendering engine.

2. Updates: When a change occurs in a React component's state or props, React creates a new virtual DOM representation. It then compares this new virtual DOM with the previous one to identify the specific changes that need to be made.

3. Efficiency: By comparing the virtual DOM representations, React determines the minimal set of changes required to update the actual DOM. This helps in optimizing performance by minimizing costly DOM manipulations.

4. Rendering: React updates only the specific parts of the actual DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire page. This selective rendering approach reduces unnecessary overhead and improves efficiency.

# Real DOM:

1. Representation: The Real DOM is the actual representation of the HTML elements on a web page, maintained by the browser's rendering engine. It is a tree-like structure that represents the structure of the page.

2. Updates: When a change occurs in the Real DOM, such as an element being added, removed, or modified, the browser rebuilds the entire DOM tree to reflect the changes.

3. Efficiency: Updating the Real DOM can be an expensive operation, especially for complex web pages or frequent updates. Rebuilding the entire DOM tree for every change can result in performance bottlenecks.

4. Rendering: The Real DOM performs a complete re-rendering of the web page whenever there is a change. This involves recalculating styles, reflowing elements, and repainting, which can be time-consuming and affect the overall performance.
