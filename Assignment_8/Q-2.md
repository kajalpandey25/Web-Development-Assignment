# Q.2 What do you understand by Virtual Dom?

The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept used by React to optimize the performance of updating and rendering user interfaces. It is a lightweight copy or representation of the actual DOM tree, which is the browser's internal representation of the HTML elements on a web page.

Here's a simplified explanation of how the Virtual DOM works:

1.When a React component's state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM representation of the component and its children.

2. React then compares this new virtual DOM with the previous virtual DOM representation.

3. By performing this comparison, React identifies the specific parts of the virtual DOM that have changed.

4. Once the differences are identified, React updates only those specific parts in the actual DOM, rather than re-rendering the entire page.
