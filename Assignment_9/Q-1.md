Q.1 What are hooks in react? how to identify hooks?
In React, hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They are a way to add stateful behavior to functional components without the need for class components. Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to simplify the management of state and side effects in React applications.

To identify hooks, there are two main rules:

Hooks start with the prefix "use": All custom hooks and built-in hooks in React start with the word "use". This naming convention is important because it tells React that a function is a hook and that it follows the rules of hooks.

Hooks are called directly in the top-level of functional components: Hooks cannot be called conditionally, inside loops, or nested within any other functions. They must always be called in the same order, and they must be called directly within the functional component body.
