# Q.7 How do you handle conditional rendering in React?

Conditional rendering in React refers to the process of conditionally displaying components or elements based on certain conditions. There are several approaches to handle conditional rendering in React:

1. if-else Statements: You can use regular JavaScript if and else statements within your component's render method or functional component to conditionally render different components or elements. Here's an example:
render() {
  if (condition) {
    return <Component1 />;
  } else {
    return <Component2 />;
  }
}


2. Ternary Operator: The ternary operator is a concise way to conditionally render content in React. It allows you to write the condition and specify the components or elements to render based on the condition in a single line. Here's an example:
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      {condition ? <Component1 /> : <Component2 />}
    </div>
  );
}

3. Logical && Operator: The logical AND (&&) operator can be used for conditional rendering when you only need to render a single component or element based on a condition. Here's an example:
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      {condition && <Component />}
    </div>
  );
}
