Q.2 Explain useState Hook & what can you achieve with it?
The useState hook is a feature introduced in React that allows functional components to manage state. It provides a way to declare and update state variables within a functional component without needing to write a class. The useState hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state.

Here's the basic syntax of the useState hook: const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

The useState hook is a feature introduced in React that allows functional components to manage state. It provides a way to declare and update state variables within a functional component without needing to write a class. The useState hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state.

Here's the basic syntax of the useState hook:

javascript Copy code const [state, setState] = useState(initialState); The useState hook takes an initial state value as its parameter and returns an array with two elements. The first element, state, represents the current state value, and the second element, setState, is a function that allows you to update the state.

By using the setState function, you can update the state value and trigger a re-render of the component. When the state is updated, React will efficiently re-render the component and update any parts of the UI that depend on the state.
