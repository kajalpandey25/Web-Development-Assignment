<!-- Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it? -->

Semantic tags in HTML are elements that convey meaning and provide structural context to the content within a web page. They describe the purpose or role of the content, rather than just specifying how it should be styled. Semantic tags make the HTML code more meaningful, accessible, and SEO-friendly.

Here are some commonly used semantic tags in HTML5:



1. <header>: Represents the introductory content or a container for the site's header section.
2. <nav>: Defines a section containing navigation links.
3. <main>: Represents the main content of the document.
4. <article>: Represents a self-contained composition, such as a blog post, news article, or comment.
5. <section>: Defines a standalone section within a document.
6. <aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the surrounding content, often presented as sidebars or callouts.
7. <footer>: Represents the footer of a document or a section.
8. <figure> and <figcaption>: Used together to represent self-contained content, such as images or diagrams, along with their captions.

    By using semantic tags, you provide better structure and meaning to the content, which offers several benefits:

1. Accessibility: Semantic tags improve web accessibility by providing screen readers and other assistive technologies with more context about the content. This helps people with disabilities navigate and understand the content more effectively.
2. SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines can better understand the structure and importance of the content when semantic tags are used. This can potentially improve the visibility and ranking of a web page in search engine results.
3. Maintainability: Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable and maintainable. The use of descriptive tags helps developers and designers understand the purpose and structure of the content, making it easier to update and modify the code in the future.
