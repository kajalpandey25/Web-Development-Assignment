<!-- <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it? -->


<!DOCTYPE html> is not a tag in HTML, but rather a document type declaration. It is used to specify the version and type of HTML being used in a web document.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is required at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. It tells the web browser which version of HTML to expect and how to interpret the markup within the document. In this case, html refers to HTML5, the latest version of the HTML standard.

By including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, you ensure that the web page is rendered correctly and consistently across different browsers. It helps browsers determine the appropriate rendering mode and layout engine to use. It also helps developers validate their HTML code against the specified doctype to ensure compliance with the HTML standard.

Overall, the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is an essential part of an HTML document that sets the foundation for proper rendering and interpretation of the markup by web browsers.
