<!-- What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag? -->


    <!-- The <figure> and <img> tags are both HTML tags used for displaying images on a web page, but they serve different purposes.

1. <img> tag:
    The <img> tag is a self-closing tag used to embed an image into an HTML document. It is used to display a single image on a webpage. Here's an example: -->


    <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2023/06/25/06/35/flower-8086459_640.jpg" alt="Description of the image">



<!-- 2. <figure> tag:
    The <figure> tag is used to group related content, such as an image or a diagram, along with its caption. It provides a semantic way to associate a caption with the content it describes. The <figure> tag can contain other elements like <img>, <figcaption>, etc. Here's an example: -->

        <figure>
            <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2023/06/28/12/43/flower-8094368_640.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
            <figcaption>Caption describing the image</figcaption>
          </figure>
