<!-- Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements? -->


In HTML, the terms "tags" and "elements" refer to different aspects of the markup language.

HTML Tags:

=> HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document.
=> They are used to define the structure and format of the content within the document.
=> Tags are represented by angle brackets (< and >) and surround the content they affect.
=> Tags can be either opening tags or closing tags. Opening tags precede the content, while closing tags follow the content and are denoted by a forward slash (/) before the tag name.
Examples of HTML tags include <h1>, <p>, <div>, <a>, etc.

    
HTML Elements:

=> An HTML element is made up of an opening tag, the content within the tag, and a closing tag (except for some self-closing tags).
=> It consists of both the tag and the content between the opening and closing tags.
=> Elements define the structure and semantics of the document and can contain other elements, forming a hierarchical structure.
=> Each element has a specific purpose and behavior defined by the HTML specification.
Examples of HTML elements include <h1>Heading</h1>, <p>Paragraph</p>, <a href="https://www.example.com">Link</a>, etc.
