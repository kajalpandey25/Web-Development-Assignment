<!-- What are some of the advantages of HTML5 over its previous versions? -->

HTML5 introduced several advantages over its previous versions, offering enhanced functionality and improved user experiences. Some of the key advantages of HTML5 include:

Semantics: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <article>, making it easier to structure web content and improve accessibility. These elements provide meaningful information to search engines and assistive technologies, resulting in better SEO and improved user experience.

Multimedia Support: HTML5 includes native support for audio and video playback without the need for third-party plugins like Flash. This enables developers to embed media elements directly into web pages using the <audio> and <video> tags, making it easier to deliver multimedia content across different devices.
