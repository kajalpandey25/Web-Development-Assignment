//  What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6?

// ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6 or ES2015) introduced several significant features and improvements to the JavaScript language. Some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6 include:

// 1. Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have lexical scoping of this and do not bind their own this, making them particularly useful for handling callback functions.

// 2. Block-Scoped Variables: The let and const keywords were introduced to declare block-scoped variables. They provide an alternative to var and help eliminate some of the issues related to variable hoisting and function scoping.

// 3. Classes: ECMAScript 6 introduced a new syntax for defining classes in JavaScript, offering a more familiar and structured way of working with objects and inheritance.

// 4. Modules: ES6 introduced native support for modules, allowing JavaScript code to be organized into separate files with explicit exports and imports. This improves code maintainability, reusability, and enables better dependency management.

// 5. Template Literals: Template literals provide an easier and more readable way to work with strings. They allow for embedded expressions and multiline strings without the need for concatenation or escaping.

// 6. Destructuring Assignment: The destructuring assignment syntax allows for extracting values from arrays or objects and assigning them to variables in a concise manner.

// 7. Enhanced Object Literals: Object literals gained several enhancements, including shorthand property and method definitions, computed property names, and the ability to define getters and setters.

// 8. Promises: Promises were introduced as a built-in way to handle asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell. Promises simplify asynchronous programming by providing a more structured and manageable approach.

// 9. Default Parameters: ES6 introduced the ability to define default values for function parameters, making it easier to handle cases where arguments are not provided.

// 10. Iterators and Generators: Iterators and generators provide more powerful ways to iterate over data structures, allowing for custom iteration behavior and lazy evaluation.
